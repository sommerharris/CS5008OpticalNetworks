# Q-Learning for Optical Networks

Welcome to our optical network repository. Please find our research paper above, titled 'CS_5800_Q_Learning_Paper.pdf'

This contains work by Nolen Belle Bryant, Kwok Keung (Andriy) Chung, Jie Feng, Sommer Harris and Kristine Umeh for our algorithms course. The objective in this project is to learn about optical networks, and present an algorithm. The phases of the project, and relevant material are listed below:

# Phase 1:
For the first phase, we learned as much as we could about optical networks, and created a paper introduction and literature review. We also gave a presentation on this initial phase of our project. The material from this stage can be found in the 'phase_1' folder. These are the foundational blocks for our final paper.

# Phase 2:
For the second phase in this project, we have creating this repository. Our goal will is to define the problem mathematically and as clear as possible. We will then define our algorithmic approach, outlining the details. Lastly, we will generate code for our solution. This code will likely be based on pre-existing code that we improve upon through our research. There will be a presentation component of this phase.

# Phase 3:
For the third phase, we ran the simulation with our updated code, and analyzed results. All of our work is summarized in our final paper and presentation.
